My Bobcat miner experience Part 1

Bobcat miner arrived after a long 3 months wait. I got started right away and began an out of box, no frills setup. The unit came with the main bobcat unit, 4dBi indoor antenna and a power adaptor.

I started looking for a good location for the unit, I decided to place it near the router as thereâ€™s ample power sockets and an reachable Ethernet connection.

After the basic setup, the unit powered on and started syncing the blockchain. This process took a couple of days for me, once synced the unit started working and making HNT.

Initial earnings were very low compared to my neighboring, same hex miner. This prompted me to begin additional research on how i can improve it.

Stay tuned as I journal my journey to earning higher HNTs!!!
