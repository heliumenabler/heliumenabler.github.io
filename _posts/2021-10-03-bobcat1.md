My Bobcat miner experience Part 1

Bobcat miner arrived after a long 3 months wait. I got started right away and began an out of box, no frills setup. The unit came with the main bobcat unit, 4dBi indoor antenna and a powe adaptor.

I started looking for a good location for the unit, I decided to place it near the router as thereâ€™s ample power sockets and an reachable Ethernet connection.
